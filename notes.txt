  The CMAKE_C_COMPILER:

  Tell CMake where to find the compiler by setting either the environment
  variable "CC" or the CMake cache entry CMAKE_C_COMPILER to the full path to
  the compiler, or to the compiler name if it is in the PATH.

and then found:
For some Ubuntu 16.04LTS (Xenial) based distros such as Mint18, you need to add:

deb http://cz.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu yakkety main universe
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-toolchain-r/test

to /etc/apt/sources.list to get the necessary packages (including g++-6). You can remove them when done.
