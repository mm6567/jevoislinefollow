  The CMAKE_C_COMPILER:

  Tell CMake where to find the compiler by setting either the environment
  variable "CC" or the CMake cache entry CMAKE_C_COMPILER to the full path to
  the compiler, or to the compiler name if it is in the PATH.

and then found:
For some Ubuntu 16.04LTS (Xenial) based distros such as Mint18, you need to add:

deb http://cz.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu yakkety main universe
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-toolchain-r/test

to /etc/apt/sources.list to get the necessary packages (including g++-6). You can remove them when done.

# Python attempt
cd ~/Documents/jevois/jevoislinefollow
jevois-create-python-module mm6567 LineFollowPy
git add *
git commit --message "moving to Python"
git push
# edited LineFollowPy.py and postinstall
cd linefollowpy
./rebuild-host.sh
jevois-daemon --loglevel=error
streamoff
listmappings
# but no LineFollowPy showing up in list
# forgot to do the add mapping step (basically have to run the postinstall script manually)
sudo ./src/Modules/LineFollowPy/postinstall
# and then re-run jevois-daemon and it is in the list
jevois-daemon --loglevel=error
streamoff

setmapping 23
streamon
# and output looks right

# ## 2018-01-28
# tedious to build and run jevois-daemon over and over, so decided to take a jpg of line to LineFollow
# and then just some straight python in StaticTest.py to try out algorithms and settings
