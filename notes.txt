For some Ubuntu 16.04LTS (Xenial) based distros such as Mint18, you need to add:

deb http://cz.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu yakkety main universe
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-toolchain-r/test

to /etc/apt/sources.list to get the necessary packages (including g++-6). You can remove them when done.

# tedious to build and run jevois-daemon over and over, so decided to take a jpg of line to LineFollow
